### Step 1 - Short-Term vs Long-Term
Buy at a good price, hold for a long time

### Step 2 - Inflation
The value of a dollar today is less than yesterday, choose investments that increase faster than inflation

### Step 3 - Investment duration
Invest for the long term and don't expect to use any of the money in the next N years

### Step 4 - Risk

#### Risk Factor # 1 - Time
The more time you have to analize the markets, the more you can take on risk with individual stocks.
The less time you have to analize the markets, the less risk you can take on and should use ETFs.

#### Risk Factor # 2 - Your Expertise
Simple can make great returns. Ex Soutwest Airlines = 110% / yr but little press vs FANG.

#### Risk Factor # 3 - Emotional Risk tolerance
10-15% paper loss, then stick to ETFs
30%+ paper loss, stocks are ok

### Step 5 - Real vs Paper Loss
Longer term, the higher the return the better the portfolio
